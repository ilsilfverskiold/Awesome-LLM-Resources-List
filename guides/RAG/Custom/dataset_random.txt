does hybrid retrieval help more for methods questions or results questions
when does using titles/abstracts beat full text retrieval
how do i stop duplicate evidence from inflating confidence in the answer

how do i benchmark how much pdf parsing noise is ruining downstream answers
when does rag actually make answers worse because retrieval brings distractors
how do i evaluate agentic rag loops without it just burning cycles forever

does compressing retrieved context help faithfulness or just hide missing evidence
how do i benchmark prompts that force the model to list contradictions explicitly
does retrieval order matter a lot, and how do i make it less brittle
how do i evaluate “i don’t know” behavior in scientific qa
how do i evaluate non-question research queries like “find me papers like X but with Y”

my query rewriting sometimes makes results worse, how do i tell when it’s hurting
how do i check if a question is even answerable from my corpus without having gold answers
how do i verify citations are actually backing the claim, not just random “looks related” refs

how often does entity linking mess up acronyms and lookalikes, and how do i test that
does retrieval make the model more “honest” or just more confident sounding
how do i measure if i’m getting diverse sources instead of 10 chunks from the same pdf
what chunking works best when papers have math and symbols everywhere
how should i chunk tables/figures/captions so retrieval doesn’t ignore them
should i retrieve whole papers first or just chunks, what actually works better
when it fails, is it usually because it missed the right paper or the right paragraph
