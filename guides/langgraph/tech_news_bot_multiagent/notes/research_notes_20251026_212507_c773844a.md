## Fact Check Report

The research notes appear to be well-organized and transparent, citing sources like HackerNews, Reddit, and Twitter. Metrics like mentions, trend, and sentiment are included, offering a quantitative overview. However, sentiment analysis is inherently subjective, and the reliance on social media introduces potential biases. The information seems generally reliable but should be interpreted with consideration for these limitations.
